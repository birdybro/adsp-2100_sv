# Program sequencer

**Status: source-backed structure; detailed RTL not started**

PC is a 14-bit register containing the currently executing address. Its
incrementer normally provides the next address [ADI-UM-1989, printed p. 4-3].
The 16-word PC stack receives PC+1 for CALL but current PC for interrupt entry
because the fetched instruction is aborted and must be retried
[ADI-UM-1989, printed pp. 4-3–4-4, 4-9].

CNTR is a 14-bit unsigned down counter. The count stack is four words. Loading a
valid new count pushes the old count, while a reset-invalid count does not waste
a stack entry [ADI-UM-1989, printed pp. 4-4–4-5].

The loop stack is four entries of 14-bit end address plus 4-bit termination
condition. DO UNTIL simultaneously pushes the loop information and first-loop
address on the PC stack [ADI-UM-1989, printed pp. 4-5–4-6]. A true explicit
jump/call/return at loop end takes precedence and suppresses implicit loop
sequencing/pops [ADI-UM-1989, printed p. 4-7].

Control-flow timing, cache interaction, stack faults, and every terminal
instruction combination require directed cycle traces before RTL.
