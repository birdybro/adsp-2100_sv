## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository governance, contribution policy, required directory layout, and
  explicit evidence-based completion rules.
- Initial reference provenance schema and safe local-cache workflow.
- Initial architecture, timing, integration, decision, and research framework.
- Foundation automation for manifest validation, repository checks, model
  tests, lint entry points, and optional-tool reporting.
- Eighteen-record reference manifest with thirteen hash-verified local sources,
  including original ADI manuals/data book, Atari schematics, and a pinned
  MAME ADSP/Hard Drivin' source set.
- Isolated sparse MAME checkout workflow pinned to commit
  `030fefcbd14e47c01ec9d67655be90f64a1dc8ab`.
- Machine-readable 30-class original opcode inventory with a complete-field,
  hand-verified all-zero NOP fixture and fail-closed schema validator.
- Primary-transcribed masks for all 30 original encoding classes, explicit
  accounting for 1,304,054 unshown-reserved words, generated synthesizable
  class decode, and a generated opcode table.
- Original RGP/REG general-MOVE table accounting for 48 register encodings,
  reserved holes, storage widths, and verified narrow-register extension
  behavior.
- Independent Python exact-width state, authentic reset-unknown
  classification, deterministic random-state/replay foundation, PM fetch
  transactions, program/data image loading, reserved-code rejection, and the
  verified NOP execution slice.
- Partial database-driven assembler/disassembler that round-trips the
  independent NOP fixture and fails closed for unimplemented/reserved words.
- Shared SystemVerilog width/phase/type package and GitHub Actions foundation
  regression.
- Complete primary-backed 4-bit IF and inverse-sense DO UNTIL condition
  databases, an independent model evaluator, synthesizable combinational
  condition logic, and exhaustive 2,048-vector RTL comparison.
- A constrained Quartus Cyclone V smoke project for the first architectural
  condition-logic block.
- Primary-transcribed exhaustive tables for all 19 remaining finite Appendix A
  abbreviations, including AMF, DREG, DAG selectors, stack controls, SF, and
  X/Y/Z operands.
- Independent model and portable RTL for all 16 standard ALU AMF functions,
  including carry/borrow, overflow, sticky AV, ABS sign, and AR saturation.
- Independent model and portable RTL for all 15 original fractional MAC AMF
  functions, including mixed signedness, 40-bit accumulation, unbiased
  rounding, MF extraction, MV, and one-shot MR saturation.
- Independent model and portable RTL for all 16 original shifter SF functions,
  including full-range HI/LO placement, PASS/OR, logical/arithmetic shifts,
  normalization, HI/HIX/LO exponent detection, EXPADJ, and explicit write
  enables.
- Independent DAG arithmetic model and portable RTL for old-I addressing,
  signed post-modification, linear and circular wrap, original-device base
  alignment, DAG1 bit reversal, and DAG2's non-reversed output.
- Independent model and portable RTL for instruction-boundary sequential,
  jump, call, return, loop-back, and loop-exit arbitration, including explicit
  control-transfer precedence at a loop end.
- Generated SystemVerilog constants for all 16 original computational DREG
  codes plus independent model and portable stateful RTL for both complete
  computational banks. The storage preserves exact SE/MR2/SB widths,
  cycle-start reads, cycle-end DREG and ALU/MAC/shifter writeback, atomic MR,
  MF middle-word extraction, MR1-to-MR2 sign extension, and fail-closed
  write-collision suppression.
- Bounded combinational formal harnesses and SymbiYosys recipes for condition,
  ALU, MAC, shifter, DAG, and sequencer-flow invariants, with assertion lint
  available without SymbiYosys.
- A stateful register-bank formal harness, 58,307-cycle DREG regression,
  50,120-cycle full-bank/writeback regression, and a constrained Cyclone V
  synthesis project.
- Machine-readable original ASTAT/MSTAT/ICNTL/IMASK fields, SSTAT field map,
  reset metadata, and interrupt-entry masks; an independent status/control
  model; and portable stateful RTL for direct writes, all four MODE CONTROL
  fields, ALU/divide/MAC/shifter status updates, exact cycle-end visibility,
  authentic ASTAT/ICNTL reset unknowns, interrupt snapshots, nested masking,
  RTI-style restoration, aborted-instruction suppression, and fail-closed
  collision handling.
- A status/control formal harness, 50,287-cycle model-versus-RTL regression,
  and a constrained Cyclone V synthesis project.
- Primary-backed four-by-sixteen status-stack metadata, an independent
  saturating LIFO model, and portable RTL with both Spp no-change codes,
  accepted push/pop state, newest-item overflow loss, sticky overflow,
  empty/overflow SSTAT sources, explicit empty-pop invalidation, and reset
  behavior.
- Eight directed/model status-stack tests, a 50,037-cycle model-versus-RTL
  regression, a bounded formal harness, and a constrained Cyclone V synthesis
  project.

### Changed

- Expanded the initial README to state the exact ADSP-2100 scope and current
  non-complete status.
- Identified the contemporary original ADSP-2100 data sheet within the 1987
  ADI data book at printed pages 2-15 onward.

### Fixed

- Made clean-checkout CI independent of the intentionally untracked reference
  cache while retaining strict local hash checks whenever the cache is present.
- Excluded ignored Quartus database products from source-text hygiene checks so
  synthesis followed by regression is deterministic.

### Verified

- Existing repository state and installed-tool baseline recorded on
  2026-07-30: Git/Python/Make/Verilator/Quartus available; pytest, Icarus,
  Yosys, SymbiYosys, and svlint unavailable.
- `make test` passes 139 Python checks, ISA/register/condition/field validators,
  thirteen cached reference hash checks, generated-file checks, strict
  Verilator 5.048 lint, 2,048 exhaustive condition-logic vectors, and 51,472
  ALU, 21,760 MAC, 644,368 shifter, 204,864 DAG, 636,512 sequencer-flow,
  58,307 stateful DREG model-versus-RTL cycles, 50,120 complete-bank
  writeback cycles, 50,287 status/control state-transition cycles, and 50,037
  status-stack state-transition cycles.
- Quartus 17.0.2 full compilation for Cyclone V `5CSEBA6U23I7` passes for the
  constrained condition block: 10 ALMs, no registers/RAM/DSPs, positive
  setup/hold slack, and zero unconstrained ports or paths.
- Quartus full compilation also passes for the constrained ALU block: 161
  ALMs, 196 combinational ALUTs, no registers/RAM/DSPs, positive setup/hold
  slack, and zero unconstrained ports or paths.
- Quartus full compilation passes for the constrained MAC block: 229 ALMs, 229
  combinational ALUTs, one inferred DSP block, no registers/RAM, positive
  setup/hold slack, and zero unconstrained ports or paths.
- Quartus full compilation passes for the constrained shifter block: 374 ALMs,
  580 combinational ALUTs, no registers/RAM/DSPs, positive setup/hold slack,
  and zero unconstrained ports or paths.
- Quartus full compilation passes for the constrained DAG block: 172 ALMs, 305
  combinational ALUTs, no registers/RAM/DSPs, positive setup/hold slack, and
  zero unconstrained ports or paths.
- Quartus full compilation passes for the constrained sequencer-flow block: 74
  ALMs, 44 combinational ALUTs, no registers/RAM/DSPs, positive setup/hold
  slack, and zero unconstrained ports or paths.
- Quartus full compilation passes for the constrained register-file block:
  1,084 ALMs, exactly 554 architectural implementation registers plus 55
  fitter-created routing duplicates, no RAM/DSPs, +9.985 ns worst setup,
  +0.109 ns worst hold slack, and zero unconstrained ports or paths.
- Quartus full compilation passes for the constrained status/control block: 84
  ALMs, 41 combinational ALUTs, exactly 21 architectural registers, no
  RAM/DSPs, +11.811 ns worst setup, +0.169 ns worst hold slack, and zero
  unconstrained ports or paths. The
  isolated virtual inputs model same-clock register-launched controls with a
  documented 5 ns arrival assumption.
- Quartus full compilation passes for the constrained status-stack block: 53
  ALMs, 30 combinational logic ALUTs, exactly 68 design registers plus one
  fitter-created routing duplicate, no RAM/DSPs, +13.077 ns worst setup,
  +0.172 ns worst hold slack, and zero unconstrained ports or paths.
- `make formal` passes strict assertion syntax lint for the condition, ALU,
  MAC, shifter, DAG, sequencer-flow, register-file, status-register, and
  status-stack harnesses; proof execution remains explicitly skipped without
  SymbiYosys.

### Documentation

- Established primary-source precedence, clean-room rules, clock/reset policy,
  signedness policy, verification expectations, and provenance requirements.
- Added first-pass original-device programmer, compute, DAG, sequencer,
  bus/timing, scope/matrix, and Hard Drivin' host/SIM/SOM/interrupt/PAL notes
  with explicit confidence boundaries.
- Closed the condition-field encoding and predicate table while leaving
  counter update, loop-stack, and instruction timing explicitly open.
- Recorded original-reserved versus later-family reuse and the Type 19 bit-5
  disagreement with MAME as explicit source conflicts.
- Recorded MAME's rounded accumulate/subtract midpoint-test divergence and
  retained the primary manual's complete-result rounding rule.
- Recorded MAME's MF-destination MV omission and retained the original
  manual's rule that every non-saturation MAC operation updates MV.
- Closed original shifter array fill, NORM AC extension, exponent range, and
  SE/SB/SS update semantics from the original compute chapter and SF table.
- Recorded the unresolved NORM `SE=0x80` negation-width edge as OQ-011; the
  provisional behavior agrees with pinned MAME and is outside generated
  exponent values.
- Recorded and implemented the original ADSP-2100 power-of-two circular-buffer
  alignment rule, explicitly distinguishing it from all later ADSP-21xx parts
  and pinned MAME (SC-010).
- Recorded the original manual's modify-equals-length allowance against the
  later family's strict inequality (SC-011).
- Recorded MAME's loop-before-instruction ordering against the original
  explicit-control-transfer precedence rule (SC-012).
- Closed the computational-bank membership and DREG access/storage slice,
  preserving undocumented reset state and recording illegal write collisions
  and interrupt-adjacent bank-switch visibility as OQ-014/OQ-015.
- Extended that slice through AF/MF/SB and unit-specific ALU/MAC/shifter
  writeback, while keeping full instruction legality, MSTAT timing, status
  writeback, and interrupt interaction explicitly incomplete.
- Closed the original ASTAT and MSTAT field maps, automatic flag-update
  sources, MODE CONTROL code effects, cycle-end flag latency, MSTAT reset
  clear, and ASTAT reset-unknown classification from the 1989 manual. Narrow
  DMD read extension and competing-write behavior are recorded as OQ-016 and
  OQ-017 rather than inferred.
- Closed the original SSTAT field map and ICNTL/IMASK storage, reset, and
  interrupt-entry mask rules. Implemented pre-entry ASTAT/MSTAT/IMASK
  snapshots and restore at a sequencer-facing boundary while leaving physical
  status-stack/SSTAT behavior and interrupt recognition explicitly incomplete.
- Resolved OQ-004 from the original 1987 ADSP-2100 data-book diagram: the
  status stack has four 16-bit entries. Combined with the original 1989
  pointer/overflow rules, this closes accepted LIFO, saturation, oldest-data
  retention, sticky overflow, and SSTAT bits 4/5 while retaining empty-pop
  effects as OQ-013.

### Known Issues

- Cross-Software, evaluation-board, independent data-sheet revisions, errata,
  and page-level opcode-field and semantic extraction remain incomplete.
- No instruction, cycle, bus, interrupt, or Hard Drivin' compatibility claim is
  complete.
- Register/status instruction-decode connectivity, MSTAT/ICNTL consumer
  wiring, PC/count/loop stacks and their SSTAT sources, narrow status reads,
  status-stack connectivity, and interrupt recognition/cycle integration are
  not implemented.
- Open-source synthesis and formal tools are not installed in this environment.
